The Pathfinder Token Pack: Bestiaries module for Foundry Virtual Tabletop was created and produced by a small but dedicated group of Foundry Virtual Tabletop staff and contractors hand-selected from the Pathfinder community, with assistance from Paizo Inc.

The Token Ring provided within this pack was custom-created by Caeora for exclusive use in this project! If you enjoy it, please consider supporting Caeora via his patreon at [https://patreon.com/caeora] or his numerous other projects at [https://www.caeora.com/]
